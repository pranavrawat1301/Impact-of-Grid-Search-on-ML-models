# Impact-of-Grid-Search-on-ML-models
Optimizing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) using Grid Search on a social network ads dataset. This project enhances model accuracy through systematic hyperparameter tuning. k-Fold Cross Validation ensures robustness, while contour plots visualize training and test set results. Explore and adapt the code for improved classification in your projects.
